# Introducing DramaYAML and SocialDrama

DramaYAML is a YAML-based markup language that aspires to be the simplest and yet most flexible way to manually transcribe dramatic social networks.
It prioritizes human readability (and writability!) while still providing the expressiveness necessary to deal with complexity.

DramaYAML's highlights include...
    - Familiar, concise syntax that you can learn to use in just a few minutes
    - Support for weighted, unweighted, directed, and undirected edges
    - Fully customizable metadata for plays, characters, and edges
    - Act and Scene divisions
    - Simple character aliases
    - Short-hand syntax for quickly enumerating character relationships

Additionally, DramaYAML comes with its own Python package, SocialDrama, that makes it easy to load, manipulate, analyze, and export DramaYAML-encoded social networks.

SocialDrama's highlights include...
    - Feature-rich Python representations of DramaYAML data
    - First-class support for both NetworkX and graph-tool
    - Conversion both to and from popular network formats like CSV, JSON, GML, and GraphML
    - Extensive documentation with loads of examples
    - A clean, readable, well-tested codebase

DramaYAML and SocialDrama want to be your go-to tools for working with dramatic social networks.
