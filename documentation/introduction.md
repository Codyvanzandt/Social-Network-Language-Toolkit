# Introducing DramaYAML and SocialDrama

DramaYAML is a YAML-based markup language that aspires to be the simplest and yet most flexible way to represent dramatic social networks.
It prioritizes human readability (and writability!) while still providing the expressiveness necessary to deal with complexity.
In short, DramaYAML takes the drudgery of transcribing dramatic networks and turns it into joy.

DramaYAML's highlights include...
    - Familiar, concise syntax that you can learn to use in just a few minutes
    - Support for weighted, unweighted, directed, and undirected edges
    - Fully customizable metadata for plays, characters, and edges
    - Logical Act and Scene divisions
    - Simple character aliases
    - Short-hand syntax for quickly enumerating character relationships

Additionally, DramaYAML comes with its own Python package, SocialDrama, that makes loading, manipulating, analyzing, and exporting DramaYAML data a breeze.

SocialDrama's highlights include...
    - Feature-rich Python representations of DramaYAML data
    - First-class support for both NetworkX and graph-tool
    - Conversion both to and from popular network formats like CSV, JSON, GML, and GraphML
    - Extensive documentation with plenty of working examples
    - A clean, readable, well-tested codebase
